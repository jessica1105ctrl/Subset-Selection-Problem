# Subset-Selection-Problem # ðŸ“˜ Subset Selection Problem

## ðŸ§© 1. Problem Statement (Version 1)

- *Goal:* Find all subsets from a given set of numbers whose *sum is zero*.  
- *Constraint:* Subset size must be *exactly 5*.  
- *Input Set:*  
  {12, -3, -6, 7, 2, 2, 6, 3, 9, -7, -5, -8, 1, 11, -9, -4}

## ðŸ§© 2. Problem Statement (Version 2)

- *Goal:* Find all subsets from a given set of numbers whose *sum is zero*.  
- *Constraint:* Subset size must be *between 3 and 6 (inclusive)*.  
- *Input Set:*  
  {12, -3, -6, 7, 2, 2, 6, 3, 9, -7, -5, -8, 1, 11, -9, -4}

## ðŸ’¡ Solution Approach

### ðŸ”„ Randomized Algorithm

A flowchart-based random approach is used:

1. Randomly select a subset of given size.
2. Calculate the sum of the subset.
3. If the sum is 0, save it.
4. Repeat until termination condition is met (e.g., max attempts or time limit).
